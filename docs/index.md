# melado: A NumPy-based Machine Learning Library for Learning and Reference

Melado is a Python library, although very immature and at its early stages, designed to provide a comprehensive collection of
machine learning algorithms implemented using only the powerful numerical
computing library, NumPy. Its primary objective is to serve as a valuable
learning resource for understanding various machine learning algorithms without
the complexity and performance considerations associated with larger machine
learning frameworks.

## Key Features:

- **Pure NumPy Implementation:** Melado leverages the capabilities of NumPy to
  create an intuitive and easily comprehensible implementation of machine
  learning algorithms. By relying solely on NumPy, it avoids external
  dependencies and allows users to focus solely on the underlying algorithmic
  principles.

- **Learning Reference:** Melado is intended as a learning tool for machine
  learning enthusiasts, beginners, and students who wish to delve into the
  inner workings of different algorithms. It emphasizes code simplicity,
  readability, and clear documentation to facilitate understanding and
  exploration.

- **Algorithm Coverage:** The library aims to encompass a broad spectrum of
  fundamental machine learning algorithms, including both supervised and
  unsupervised techniques. From linear regression and logistic regression to
  k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA), Melado provides a
  diverse set of implementations to grasp the core concepts.

- **Modular Structure:** Melado adopts a modular structure, ensuring that each
  algorithm is encapsulated within its own module or class. This approach
  promotes modularity, making it easy to study and modify specific algorithms
  or integrate them into existing projects.

- **Educational Examples:** Melado includes a range of illustrative examples
  and use cases that demonstrate the practical application of each algorithm.
  These examples aim to reinforce learning by showcasing how algorithms can be
  utilized in real-world scenarios.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Aims for a straightforward and consistent API,
  Melado ensures a smooth learning experience.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Melado provides detailed documentation for
  each algorithm, including explanations of underlying concepts, mathematical
  formulations, and step-by-step implementation details. This comprehensive
  documentation enhances the learning process and acts as a reference for
  users.

Melado is a versatile machine learning library that aims to bridge the gap
between theory and practice. By implementing algorithms using NumPy, it offers
a simplified and pedagogical approach for individuals interested in
understanding the inner workings of machine learning. Whether you are a
beginner or an experienced practitioner, Melado empowers you to explore and
expand your knowledge of machine learning algorithms.
