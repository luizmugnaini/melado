# `melado` üçØ

Melado is a Python library, although very immature and at its early stages, designed to provide a comprehensive collection of
machine learning algorithms implemented using only the powerful numerical
computing library, NumPy. Its primary objective is to serve as a valuable
learning resource for understanding various machine learning algorithms without
the complexity and performance considerations associated with larger machine
learning frameworks.
