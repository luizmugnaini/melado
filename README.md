Melado is a Python library designed to provide a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms
implemented using only the powerful numerical computing library, NumPy. Its
primary objective is to serve as a valuable learning resource for understanding
various machine learning algorithms without the complexity and performance
considerations associated with larger machine learning frameworks. You can find
more about melado in its [documentation](https://melado.readthedocs.io).

## Features

- Comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms.
- Implemented using NumPy for efficient numerical computations.
- Easy-to-understand codebase for educational purposes.
- Simple and straightforward API.

## Installation

You can install Melado using pip:

```shell
pip install melado
```

## Usage

To use Melado, simply import the desired algorithm from the library and apply it to your data. Here's
an example of using the [weighted linear regression algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_least_squares):

```python
from melado.linear import LinearRegression

# Prepare your data
X_train, y_train = ...
weights_train = ...

# Create a LinearRegression object
lin_reg = LinearRegression()

# Fit the data
lin_reg.fit(X_train, y_train, weights_train)

new_data, data_weights = ...

# Predict values from new data
labels = lin_reg.predict(new_data, data_weights)
```

After cloning the repository, install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) with your favorite package manager

```shell
paru -Syu python-poetry
```

Go to the `melado` directory and run the `start` script, which will install the virtual
environment using Poetry:

```shell
./start
```

The available `Makefile` can be used to either run the tests, run the
[Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/) linter, run the [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/)
typechecker, and build the docs with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/):

```shell
make {tests,lint,docs}
```
